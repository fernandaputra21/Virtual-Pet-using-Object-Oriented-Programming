# Virtual-Pet
Understanding Object Oriented Programming and GUI using tkinter in Python 

This is a beginner project for understanding class, objects, and methods in object oriented programming.

Virtual pet is inspired from kids toys in early 2000s, the gameplay of the toy is about nurturing a creature inside a small device, we can also interact with the creature.
This program is intended to work in similar manner but in a very simple way, the only interactions we can do with the pet are "greet" and "feed" by clicking the buttons.

Feel free to modify.
